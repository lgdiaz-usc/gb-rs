dawg I have no idea

it plays gameboy games. do you know what those are? they're what we used to play before apple invented the "smart phone". back in my day we we had to to walk 9 miles uphill in the ssnow to make a phone ccall. both ways. now you have slab in your pocket that can do it in an instant. and it gives you depression. the future really is now.
